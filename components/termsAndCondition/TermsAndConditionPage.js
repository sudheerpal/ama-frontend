        <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold">Our Contract</h2>
        <p className="mb-5">
          Once you place an order for a product listed on our website, payment
          for that product becomes due and owing immediately. Notwithstanding
          the fact that the product will not be dispatched until the price of
          the product(s) and service(s) are received in full, you are liable to
          pay Market Research Forecast all amounts due on foot of the order.
          Once we receive your order, we have to purchase the product from the
          publisher, process the payment, and arrange the shipping. Because of
          this element of work involved, we regret that it is not possible for
          an order to be canceled once it is submitted. Market Research Forecast
          will not be responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our
          obligations under our contract with you where such delay or failure
          arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control.
        </p>

          the items in our catalog may be mispriced. Rest assured, however, that
