              <p>
                Consulting WP is a global consulting powerhouse. We began our
                operations a few decades ago and have grown due to excellent
                relationships with our clients. We started out small, with just
                a few people and a small office, but today we have offices in
                multiple countries with hundreds of people working inside them.{" "}
                <br />
                We achieved our success because of how successfully we integrate
                with our clients. One compl- aint many people have about
                consultants is that they can be disruptive. Employees fear
                outside consultants coming in and destroying the workflow. Our
                clients face no such issues.
